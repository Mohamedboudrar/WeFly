# Private Jets Reservation System

This is a PHP-based system for booking private jet reservations. The system allows users to view available jets, make reservations, and manage their bookings. This README provides instructions for installing, setting up, and running the project locally.

## Features

- Browse available private jets
- Make reservations
- View booking history
- Admin panel for managing reservations and jets

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PHP** (Version 7.4 or higher)
- **MySQL** (or MariaDB)
- **Apache** or any web server with PHP support
- **phpMyAdmin** for managing the MySQL database (optional)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/private-jets-reservation.git
Step 2: Set Up the Database
Open phpMyAdmin (typically accessible at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).

Create a new database:

Name the database (e.g., private_jets_db).
Choose utf8_general_ci as the collation (or the default collation for your version).
Click "Create."
Import the database file:

In phpMyAdmin, click on the database you just created (e.g., private_jets_db).
Click on the Import tab.
Click "Choose File" and select the database file (database.sql) found in this repository.
Click "Go" to import the database structure and data.
Step 3: Configure the Database Connection
In the project directory, locate the config.php file (or a similarly named file for configuration).
Open it and modify the database connection details to match your local environment:
php

<?php
$host = 'localhost';  // Database host
$dbname = 'private_jets_db';  // Database name
$username = 'root';  // Database username
$password = '';  // Database password
?>
Step 4: Set Up the Web Server
If you're using Apache, place the project folder in the htdocs directory (or the appropriate directory for your web server).

Start the Apache server and MySQL service using XAMPP or WAMP (if you're using them).
Navigate to http://localhost/ in your browser to see the project in action.
Running the Project
After setting up the database and web server, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/private-jets-reservation (or the path where your project is stored).
You should now see the main landing page of the Private Jets Reservation System.
You can start browsing the available jets, making reservations, and managing your bookings.
